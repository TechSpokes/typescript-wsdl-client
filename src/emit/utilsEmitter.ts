/**
 * TypeScript SOAP Client Utilities Emitter

 * to properly handle XML serialization and deserialization. It creates metadata mappings
 * that enable the client to distinguish between XML attributes and child elements during
 * the conversion process between TypeScript objects and XML.
 *
 * The generated utilities include:
 * - A DataTypes interface defining the structure of the metadata
 * - A constant containing the actual metadata mappings extracted from the compiled catalog

/**
 * Emits utility types and constants for XML serialization/deserialization
 *
 * This function generates a TypeScript file containing metadata mappings that help
 * the SOAP client distinguish between XML attributes and child elements during
 * the conversion process. It exports:
 *
 * 1. A DataTypes interface defining the structure of the metadata
 * 2. A constant containing the actual mappings extracted from the compiled catalog
 *
 * The metadata is critical for proper XML marshalling and unmarshalling, as it enables
 * the client to correctly handle XML attributes vs. child elements, maintain type information
 * during recursive processing, and ensure that the XML structure matches the WSDL specification.
 *
 * @param {string} outFile - Path to the output TypeScript file
 * @param {CompiledCatalog} compiled - The compiled WSDL catalog containing metadata
 * @throws {Error} If metadata is missing or has an invalid structure
