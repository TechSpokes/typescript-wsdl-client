# Roadmap

Short-term
- Stabilize CLI flags and help text
- Expand XSD coverage (groups, attributeGroup, any/anyAttribute handling)
- Improve error messages with line/column context
- Minimal e2e tests with fixture WSDLs (smoke + compile-only)

Medium-term
- Typed inputs/outputs per operation in client emitter
- Multiple WSDLs and service selection
- Better namespace conflict resolution reporting
- Typedoc API docs for programmatic usage

Long-term
- Pluggable transports (bypass node-soap) and XML serializer
- WSDL 2.0 exploration (if demand exists)
