# Welcome to TypeScript WSDL Client Discussions!

We're excited to have you here! This is where our community connects to discuss SOAP/WSDL integration challenges, share solutions, and shape the future of type-safe SOAP clients in TypeScript.

## What This Tool Does

`typescript-wsdl-client` transforms WSDL/XSD schemas into fully-typed TypeScript SOAP clients. If you're dealing with enterprise SOAP services, legacy system integration, or just want to eliminate the pain of manual SOAP client coding, you're in the right place!
