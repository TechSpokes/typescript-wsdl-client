# Working With Generated Code

Guide to using the TypeScript SOAP clients and types generated by wsdl-tsc.

See [README](../README.md) for quick start and [Concepts](concepts.md) for type modeling details.

## Client Construction

```typescript
import soap from "soap";
import { Weather } from "./src/services/weather/client.js";

const client = new Weather({
  source: "https://example.com/WeatherService?wsdl",
  security: new soap.WSSecurity("username", "password")
});
```

The `source` parameter accepts a URL or local file path to the WSDL.

## Calling Operations

```typescript
const forecast = await client.GetCityForecastByZIP({
  ZIP: "10001"
});

console.log(forecast.GetCityForecastByZIPResult.Success);
console.log(forecast.GetCityForecastByZIPResult.ForecastResult);
```

Operations without input still require an empty object:

```typescript
const info = await client.GetWeatherInformation({});
console.log(info.GetWeatherInformationResult.WeatherDescriptions);
```

## Attributes and Text Content

When an element has both attributes and text content, use the $value convention:

```typescript
const price = {
  currencyCode: "USD",
  $value: "123.45"
};
```

See [Concepts](concepts.md) for details on the flattening model and $value convention.

## Working With Arrays

Repeated elements are automatically typed as arrays:

```typescript
interface ForecastReturn {
  Forecast: Forecast[];  // maxOccurs > 1
}
```

## Type Safety

All operations and types are fully typed:

```typescript
const result: GetCityWeatherByZIPResponse = await client.GetCityWeatherByZIP({
  ZIP: "10001"
});

result.GetCityWeatherByZIPResult.Temperature;
```

Autocomplete and type checking work across all generated interfaces.
